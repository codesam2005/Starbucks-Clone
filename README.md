# ☕ Starbucks Website Clone (Beginner Level)

This is a beginner-level project — a simple Starbucks landing page built purely with HTML and CSS.  
The code is handwritten by me (not generated by GPT) as part of learning web development.

## About This Project
- Non-responsive design (desktop-focused layout)
- Basic HTML structure with CSS styling using Flexbox for layout
- Uses Font Awesome icons for social media and location
- Includes multiple sections showcasing Starbucks promotions and info
- Buttons and links are placeholders with no backend or functionality

## Technologies
- HTML5
- CSS3
- Font Awesome (for icons)

## How to Use
1. Download or clone the project files
2. Open `index.html` in a web browser
3. Make sure `styles.css` and `logo.png` are located in the same folder as `index.html`

## Notes
- Images are hotlinked from Starbucks official sources
- This project is a learning exercise; design may not be fully responsive or polished
- No JavaScript or backend is involved
